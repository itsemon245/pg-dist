      ## üîπ Stage 2 -- Story Processing (Processor)

      -   Eye color & facial expressions
      -   Clothing, shoes, accessories
      -   Distinct quirks/mannerisms

      **Example:**

      out in every direction and bright, sparkling blue eyes that light up
      with wonder. He wears a faded blue t-shirt with a picture of a rocket
      ship on it and a pair of worn-out sneakers that have seen their fair
      share of adventures.

      **Step 2: Story Page Division**
      - Divide story into 1--3 sentences per page.
      - Smooth pacing and clarity.

      - If 2 characters appear ‚Üí paste both.
      - If 3+ characters appear ‚Üí paste all of them.

          The Talking Tree:  
          The Talking Tree is a grand old oak with deep grooves in its bark that resemble a wise face. Its eyes are made of golden sap that glows faintly, and its leaves shimmer in different shades of green. Its roots curl gently like open arms.
